                    That's the day we met, the day I was blessed with
                    getting to know you. You're the highlight of my life.
                    I'll never forget the excitement I felt when I met you,

                        Being with you was such a one of a kind experience.
                        I still look back at those days with a smile.

        <p style="font-family: Monaco, monospace;">a little too much, but even if that's true, I only find peace and comfort in that.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Monaco, monospace;">I hope you liked this, I'm sorry that the sprites were a bit bad, I tried to make sure</p>
        <p style="font-family: Monaco, monospace;">to add something of your taste, even if it's not of the best quality :D</p>
        <p style="font-family: Monaco, monospace;">I still dream about the day we'll be together in Athens like this. </p>
